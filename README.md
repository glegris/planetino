## Planetino

Planetino is a 3D engine in pure Java (OpenGL is not required). It focus on FPS (First Person Shooting) games.

The current backend is AWT but adding a new one is easy.

Planetino was initially developed as a side project of [MIDPath](midpath.thenesis.org) in order to test 3D features.
